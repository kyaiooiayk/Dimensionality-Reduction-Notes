# Dimensionality Reduction
*List of templates focused on dimensionality reduction*

## A note on the notebook rendering
Each notebook has two versions (all python scripts are unaffected by this):
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in black& white. These are placed in the folder named `GitHub_MD_rendering` where MD stands for MarkDown.
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in coloured background.

## Macro topics
- Curse of dimensionality
- ICA = Indipendent Component Analysis
- NCA = Neighborhood Component Analysis
- PCA = Principal Component Analysis
- SVD = Singulat Value Decomposition
